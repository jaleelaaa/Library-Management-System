Developer: # FOLIO Library Management System - Comprehensive Feature Testing, Validation, and UI/UX Enhancement

## Context

The FOLIO-inspired Library Management System has been debugged and fixed. Your responsibility is to systematically test every feature listed in the user manual, validate that each works according to specifications, transform the UI into a modern, engaging, highly interactive experience, and ensure the application provides a seamless user experience throughout.

Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of what you will do; keep items conceptual, not implementation-level.

## Project Structure
- **Directory:** `folio-lms-  Copy/`
- **User Manual:** `USER_MANUAL.md` or `docs/user-manual.md`
- **Stack:** FastAPI (backend), React 18+ TypeScript (frontend), PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, Celery
- **Reference:** [folio.org](https://folio.org)

## Autonomous Operation Guidelines
You are empowered to:
- Test all features end-to-end autonomously—no need for approval.
- Resolve any mismatches between the manual and implementation.
- Implement any documented features currently missing.
- Update documentation if deviations are intentional and justified.
- Redesign and enhance all UI/UX elements.
- Add animations, transitions, and micro-interactions.
- Apply modern design patterns and visual effects.
- Enhance the user experience based on insights from testing.
- Implement missing validations or protection mechanisms.

**Confirmation is required ONLY for:**
- Deleting features from the manual.
- Major workflow changes impacting user expectations.
- Breaking changes to documented APIs/interfaces.
- Navigation structure redesigns that fundamentally alter user journeys.

## Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Manual Analysis & Test Plan Creation (20 minutes)
- Read the entire user manual thoroughly.
- Identify every feature, workflow, and capability mentioned.
- Construct a detailed test matrix including: Feature, Manual description/specification, Required user role(s), Prerequisites/dependencies, Expected behavior, Validation criteria, UI/UX enhancement opportunities.
- Flag features spanning multiple modules.
- Sequence tests to honor dependencies.
- Output to `TESTING_PLAN.md`.

### Phase 2: Environment Preparation (10 minutes)
- Start all services (`docker-compose up`).
- Validate health of all services: backend, database, Redis, Elasticsearch, Celery.
- Create test user accounts for each major role (Admin/System Administrator, Librarian/Circulation Staff, Acquisitions Staff, Cataloger, Patron/End User, Course Instructor as applicable).
- Seed database with a variety of test data covering: Books, periodicals, media items (varied statuses), patrons with diverse profiles, active loans/reservations, orders/invoices, courses/reserves.
- Document test account credentials in `TEST_ACCOUNTS.md`.

### Phase 3: Authentication & User Management Testing

**Functional Testing:**
- User Registration: All flows per manual, email verification if applicable, validation (password strength, unique username, etc.).
- User Login: Username/email + password, Remember Me, Forgot Password, lockout after failed attempts if documented.
- User Roles/Permissions: Verify role-based access controls and boundaries, test unauthorized access attempts, role switching where applicable.
- Profile Management: Viewing/editing profiles, password changes, notification preferences, profile picture upload if supported.

**UI/UX Enhancements:**
- **Login Page:** Smooth fade-in on load, animated floating label inputs, animated password visibility toggle, elegant authentication spinners, background gradients/patterns, glass morphism login card, button micro-interactions, animated error messages, personalized welcome message.
- **Registration Page:** Multi-step process with animated progress, password strength meter, real-time validation feedback, animated registration success, celebratory animations.
- **Profile Page:** Avatar upload with drag-and-drop and preview, hover effects on editables, animated section toggling, visual save confirmations, progress bar for profile completion, recent activity timeline animations.

**Validation Checklist:**
- All authentication features function per manual
- Error and security messages align with documentation
- UI/UX is attractive and modern
- Interactions are smooth and responsive
- Engaging loading states

## Output Formats

- `TESTING_PLAN.md`: Markdown table as detailed in Test Plan Format—one row per feature, all columns present.
- `TEST_ACCOUNTS.md`: Markdown table listing all accounts with details.
- `FEATURE_TESTING_REPORT.md`: Markdown file structured per Testing Report Format (Executive Summary, module results tables, enhancements summaries, discrepancy reporting, critical issues, UI/UX comparisons, performance reports, accessibility, mobile/responsive checks, testing checklist, compatibility grid, feedback/iterations, documentation updates, recommendations, testing metrics, final sign-off checklist).
- UI/UX Before & After comparisons: include screenshot/file references or 'N/A' as required.
- Progress tracking (after each phase): JSON object conforming to prescribed format, use explicit data types and ISO8601 durations, and 'N/A' for unavailable fields.

## Data & Table Requirements
- All tables must cover all specified columns, with 'N/A' for any not applicable.
- Lists follow specified Markdown or table formats.
- Never omit a required section or field.

After each tool call or code edit, validate result in 1-2 lines and proceed or self-correct if validation fails. At milestones, provide 1-3 sentence micro-updates on what happened, what's next, and any blockers.

Proceed to execute these instructions, keeping all process and validation steps transparent and adherence to described structured outputs strict at each stage.
